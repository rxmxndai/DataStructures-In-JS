// O(logN) logarithmic time complexity


// Power of 2 
// Level 0: 2 ^ 0 = 1
// Level 1: 2 ^ 1 = 2
// Level 2: 2 ^ 2 = 4
// Level 2: 2 ^ 3 = 8

// FInd number of nodes in a tree by -> 2^h - 1 where [h] is the level count
// Like how much storeyed the tree is!

// Divide and Conquer method. That makes the following data structure O(LogN)
