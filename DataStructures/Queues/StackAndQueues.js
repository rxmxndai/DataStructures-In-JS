// ******************************** Stacks ********************************
/*
    Based on LIFO principle
    Can be implemented with Linked List for better control and efficiency
    Example: Plates in hotel, stacked upon each other vertically and only can be accessed from the top

    Lookups: O(n)
    Insert: O(1)
    Push: O(1)
    Peek: O(1) Last Element

// ******************************** Queues ********************************
/*
    Based on FIFO principle
    Can be implemented with Arrays (Bad), Linked List or Dequeues

    Lookup: O(n)
    Enqueue: O(1)
    Dequeue: O(1)
    Peek: O(1) First element

// Lesser operations than lower level data structures like Linked Lista nd Arrays
