/* Trees */

// Contains Roots, Parents, Roots, Children, Siblings
// A data structure that represents the hierarchical struture of real tree but upside down
// The main node is called root connnected to children nodes with edges


/* Binary Tree */
// Each node can only have 0, 1, or 2 node and Each child can only have one parent
// Perfect Binary Tree: 
/*
    -That is complete and full
    -Bottom layer is also filled
    -More Efficient
    -Sum of all nodes above it === Number of nodes in the same row - 1
*/
// Full Binary Tree: will never have a single child node 


// Big O's
// Lookups: O(logN) 
// Insert: O(logN) 
// Delete: O(logN) 



// Binary Search Tree
// Preserves the relationship and has a faster lookup
// Right side nodes must be greater than the left side nodes

// Cons
// Unbalanced List -> Lookup might be longer
// There is no O(1) operations in a Binary Search Tree

// Pros
// Really good performance | Better than O(n) assuming the Tree is balanced
// Ordered and flexible size
